# off_highway_premium_radar

The off_highway_premium_radar package provides a driver node to receive and send UDP datagrams from
/ to the Bosch Radar Off-Highway Premium via a ROS interface.

Further information on the Bosch Radar Off-Highway Premium, it's inputs, outputs and how they can be
interpreted can be found in the corresponding Technical Customer Information (TCI), which is
provided with the sensor hardware.

The driver is only tested for sensor unicast configuration for varying sensor IPs and destination
ports on the host.

## Nodes

### Driver

The radar driver opens an UDP socket, decodes all UDP protocol data units (PDUs) from the radar and
publishes its data as ROS messages. Moreover, it can send all required input for the radar as UDP
PDUs. See the following figure for an overview:

![Sensor Driver Architecture](doc/media/driver_setup.drawio.svg "Sensor Driver Architecture")

The signal values in a received PDU are checked for their value range and replaced by their
corresponding signal-not-available (SNA) value if out of range (if applicable).

The split location data PDUs per measurement are assembled by the driver as single location data
measurement and published as single ROS point cloud message. There is **no** built-in recovery in
the driver for out-of-order or dropped UDP packets for such a sequence of packets. A warning will
log such cases which result in a drop of the location measurement (and eventually the following one
if out-of-order packet). Such cases will also result in a publishing frequency drop for the output
message which is detected in the built-in ROS diagnosis. Reducing the load on the sensor network and
receiving device will minimize the risk of such cases.

A location data measurement may contain zero locations if the data measured flag is not set or zero
number of contained locations are measured. In addition, only locations are contained in the drivers
output which have the first bit of their measurement status set (measured and range check passed).

Each cyclic input and output topic of the driver is monitored via ROS topic diagnostics, which
checks its frequency and timestamp and publishes on `/diagnostics` the current status. As soon as
the driver is not receiving UDP packets with the expected frequency (see UDP interface
documentation) or not updated timestamps, the corresponding topic diagnostics will produce an error.

In order that the driver can communicate to the sensor, one needs to configure the connection via
the network parameters. The host IP, port and sensor IP, port need to be set to the settings
configured in the sensor. The defaults are stated in the UDP interface documentation and in the
[parameters](#parameters).

One can connect the used socket via the `connect_sensor` parameter to already filter for UDP packets
from the sensor before the driver process receives them. This has the main benefit of being able to
run multiple driver processes for different sensors in parallel for the same host port
([established-over-unconnected technique]). The disadvantage is that each driver socket will not be
able to receive, process and publish sensor broadcast messages.

The driver node is written as library in a modular fashion so that one can extend its functionality
with custom converter classes. See [design](doc/design.md) for an overview.

    interface specification!

## Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)

This library uses a modified `UdpSocket` class from the [udp_driver
class](https://github.com/ros-drivers/transport_drivers/tree/main/udp_driver) to send and receive
UDP frames. See the [FOSS documentation](foss_documentation/) for further information.
