# off_highway_uss

The off_highway_uss package provides a receiver node to receive and decode CAN frames of the Bosch
Ultrasonic Sensor System (USS) Off-Highway into ROS messages - it implements an
`off_highway_can::Receiver`. Furthermore, the package provides a sender node to encode and send
needed USS input data as CAN frames - an implementation of an `off_highway_can::Sender`.

Further information on the Bosch USS Off-Highway, it's inputs, outputs and how they can be
interpreted can be found in the corresponding [Technical Customer Documentation (TCD) of the sensor
system](https://www.bosch-mobility-solutions.com/en/solutions/assistance-systems/ultrasonic-sensor-systems-ohw/).

## Nodes

### Receiver

The USS receiver decodes CAN frames into an object list and an direct echo list, manages the current
lists and publishes them cyclically.

All received messages are checked for their cyclic redundancy check (CRC), rolling message counter
and age (message not older than parameter `allowed_age`). If any of these checks do not succeed the
received message is not further processed and skipped.

The relevant USS CAN frame IDs to process (`object_base_id`, `direct_echo_base_id`,
`max_detection_range_id` and `info_id`) are calculated from the `can_id_offset` parameter with
constant offsets. It should correspond to the value configured in the USS ECU and needs to be
adapted for the specific bus setup. If multiple USS systems need to be decoded on the same bus just
launch multiple receiver nodes with individual `can_id_offset` parameters.

The object data is published as a list of objects or as a point cloud and contains up to 20 objects
(sensor limit). Only valid objects in the list are published (type not `TYPE_NONE`). Line objects in
the point cloud format are sampled between their first and second position into individual points
based on the `line_sample_distance` parameter. If this parameter is zero, only the end points of the
line segment are put in the point cloud.

An object CAN frame is multiplexed by the USS, so that the same CAN frame ID is used for two
objects. Thus, for uniqueness, the `id` fields of an object in both published list formats are
computed by adding the multiplexor value times ten to the the enumeration the CAN frame IDs starting
from the `object_base_id` as zero. This results in an object `id` in the range [0, 20).

The direct echo data is published as a list of direct echos and contains up to 12 direct echos
(fills up at start till one set is received). The echo's `id` field is the enumeration of the CAN
frame IDs starting from the `direct_echo_base_id` as zero. This results in an echo `id` in the range
[0, 12).

The echo data list is accompanied by the `max_detection_range` message, which contains the current
maximum detection range for all 12 individual ultrasonic sensors as array.

If the receiver node does not receive anything within a configured period (parameter `timeout`), it
will publish a diagnostic error on `/diagnostics`. Also, the sensor information CAN frame is
published and checked as diagnostic status of the USS. On error, the node publishes a diagnostic
error.

#### Parameters

See [receiver_params.yaml](config/receiver_params.yaml).

### Sender

The USS sender listens for ROS ambient temperature messages as input and encodes and publishes these
as CAN frame.

In the case that there is no ambient temperature reading available, the USS can be configured with a
fixed value (see TCD) and this sender node is not needed.

The CAN temperature signal can only encode the range of [-40&deg;C, 87&deg;C], ROS messages
containing temperature values outside of this range are discarded and not encoded / published.
Furthermore, if the ROS temperature message is too old (parameter `allowed_age`) it is discarded,
too.

The relevant USS CAN frame ID to publish the temperature is specified by the
`outside_temperature_id` parameter. This parameter needs to correspond to the vehicle data ID for
the specific bus setup. If multiple USS systems are connected on the same bus, a single USS sender
is sufficient as long as these USS systems expect the vehicle data frame on the same ID (in contrast
to multiple receivers).

If the sender node does not receive anything valid within a configured period (parameter `timeout`),
it will publish a diagnostic error on `/diagnostics`.
